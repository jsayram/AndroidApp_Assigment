This application (MealPrep) helps users to decide on what meal they want to prep and how to prep the
meal they desire.

# First Iteration(10/12/2016):

We have chosen to implement these for our first iteration; it defines the main purpose
of our application. The three user stories implemented are displayed below:

# Feature Name: Breakfast

		As an early bird
		So that I can search for an appropriate meal
		I want to eat according to what time of the day it is


One breakfast meal is added to the application where a user can view a picture of the full
breakfast meal.

# Feature Name: View Recipe

		As a Cook
		So that I know what is needed to meal prep
		I want to see recipes as needed

Users can view the ingredients for that meal separated into 3 portions: carbohydrates, protein,
and vegetables/fruit.


# Feature Name: BMI Calculator

		As a Bodybuilder
		So that I can be ready for competition
		I want to see the a BMI chart

Users can view the Body Mass Index (BMI) chart showing the average BMI based on age, height, and
weight.

Testing the welcome screen was difficult because it was hard to determine if the welcome screen has
a 2-second animation. Once the welcome screen is viewed, the animation shortly fades to the main
activity displaying breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Staying agile helped us make changes to improve our application.
